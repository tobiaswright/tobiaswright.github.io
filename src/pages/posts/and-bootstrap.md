## …and Bootstrap

Back in my hackathon days, it seemed that all of a sudden, no matter what the pitch, more and more of them ended their ad hoc tech stack with “…and twitter Bootstrap”, for example you might hear something like, “For my project, I used node, express and Twitter Bootstrap”. Later shortened to just “…and bootstrap”.

Bootstrap in the instance is a [frontend framwork](https://getbootstrap.com/). Over the next few years it became the visual language for a lot of startups because of its’ ease of use and allowed developers not to have to worry about the UI as much. I’d say it’s biggest step-up at the time was page layout, and to a lesser extent, its JS library.

It’s killer feature? [It didn’t get in the way and may me feel awesome](https://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/01/users_shouldnt_.html)

Even today when you go to homepage it says, “The Most popular HTML, CSS and JS Library in the world” – which may actually true, everyone used bootstrap.

### So what happen?

This is only conjecture, but I think it’s a combination of things.
- More options, there are more [front-end libraries now then you can shake a stick at](https://www.creative-tim.com/blog/educational-tech/bootstrap-alternatives/)
- CSS finally caught up. [Grid and Flexbox](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/comparison-between-css-grid-css-flexbox/) make layout incredibly easy.
- It feels a little dated and unimpressive given its ubiquity.

And finally what sent me off looking for alternatives:

It feels clumsy given how frontend has moved over to component architecture. Although I hate the idea of tailwindCSS, as I don’t think it handles [DRY principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) particular well, it feels so much better dealing with style encapsulation with self-contained styles.

Additionally, FOMO! I wanted to see how others approach the problem. There are plenty of alternatives as I have found out. I’m currently giving [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) a try in a project, and so far, it’s not gotten in the way.  It’s a good way to start.
