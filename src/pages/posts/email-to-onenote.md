## Email to OneNote

### nvm, this service has been discontinued starting March 2025

Every couple of years I ask “re-discover” why I don’t use email to OneNote. I’m writing this down to help my future self.

tl;dr: Email to OneNote works for outlook email, it does not work for gmail. Work arounds do work.

How to set up:
1.	https://www.onenote.com/EmailSettings. You’ll need to sign in. Here you can set up which email you’d like to use to email to OneNote.
2.	Send any email you want to show up in OneNote using me@onenote.com

If you are using an outlook.com email you can stop here. It’s going to work.

If you are using gmail, it will not work, workarounds can work. To summeraize:

**What will work:**
-	Using an outlook.com email address

**What does not work:**
- Emailing me@onenote from gmail
- Forwarding to outlook.com address, and setting up a rule to forward to onenote

**Workarounds that will work, if you need it to reeeeeally work from gmail:**
-	Third party-services like ifttt, zapier or PowerApps
