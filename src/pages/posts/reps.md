## Getting your reps in

One of the biggest mistakes I made when getting into front-end design is using jQuery rather than learning the fundamentals of javascript. The price for being immediately productive has left me even now, with embarrassing gaps in my knowledge of the fundamentals of JavaScript. It is an expensive price.

I'm currently learning Java and I’m determined not to make the same mistake by skipping straight to springboot, which is part of the stack we use, I taking the proper way and getting a good foundation in Java first. To that end, after a couple search landing me at the MOOCfi.
There are two things that I really like about it.

1.	It’s java
2.	It covers basic object oriented design
3.	The reps

In the MOOCfi, in addition to adding concepts, you have to type basic things like while loops, making list, creating classes, etc, over and over again. And over and over again. I don’t consider myself even marginally competent yet with designing flexible solutions in Java, I find that I’m fighting less with the mechanics of the language and concentrating more on the concepts. The specifics of the language are falling away.

And here's the science, according to ChatGPT:

> Repetitive learning, often referred to as "spaced repetition," is a powerful technique in the science of learning. This method involves consistently revisiting the same material over time, which helps reinforce memory and understanding. By engaging in repetitive tasks, learners strengthen neural connections, making recall more efficient and automatic. This approach is particularly effective in mastering complex subjects, as it allows learners to shift their focus from struggling with the basics to grasping more advanced concepts. 

I found it true when I played football. I finding it as I take up golf and now with learning java.

Here are some tips to get your reps in:

- Write out code examples or anything you pull from a ChatGPT by hand, rather than copy and paste.

- As you learn new things, instead of waiting for a chance to use you new and shiney piece of knowledge, review old projects or solutions. Maybe it's time for a rewrite!
