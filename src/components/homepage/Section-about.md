Hi, I’m Tobias, a passionate technologist with a two-decade-long career in software engineering. Even after all this time I still find the internet fascinating and enjoy being a citizen. Here you'll find some of my writings, personal projects and links I've found interesting and like to share.

When I'm not in front of a screen, I enjoy biking, reading, beekeeping, listening to music and lately been getting into vexillology.

I graduated with honors from New York University and Alabama A&M University, where I also played offensive tackle in NCAA Division 1 football. I’ve served on the NYU Alumni Board and taught community education at Temple University. I’m deeply committed to mentoring and creating a welcoming space for new programmers to grow.
