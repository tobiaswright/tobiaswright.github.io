I’m Tobias, a passionate technologist with a two-decade-long career in software engineering. Even after all this time I still find the internet fasinating and enjoy being a citizen. Here you'll find some of my writing, personal projects.

When I'm not in front of a screen, I enjoy biking, reading, beekeeping, listening to music and lately been having a jones for vexillology.

I graduated with honors from New York University and Alabama A&M University, where I also played offensive tackle in NCAA Division 1 football. I’ve served on the NYU Alumni Board and taught community education at Temple University. I’m deeply committed to diversity and inclusion in tech, mentoring and creating a welcoming space for new programmers to grow.
